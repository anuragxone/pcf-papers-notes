Let's delve into these terms, primarily related to nonlinear optics and optical fiber communication:

**1. ZDW (Zero Dispersion Wavelength)**:
The Zero Dispersion Wavelength (ZDW) is the specific wavelength at which the dispersion of an optical fiber becomes zero. In simpler terms, it is the wavelength at which the effects of positive (normal) dispersion and negative (anomalous) dispersion cancel each other out. 

For silica-based optical fibers:
- The ZDW typically lies around 1.3 µm. 
- Below this wavelength, the fiber exhibits normal dispersion.
- Above this wavelength, the fiber exhibits anomalous dispersion.

The ZDW is of significant interest because around this wavelength, several nonlinear optical phenomena, including soliton formation and supercontinuum generation, can be efficiently observed due to the unique balance between dispersion and nonlinearity.

**2. Pump Wavelength**:
In the context of nonlinear optics or optical amplifiers, the pump wavelength refers to the wavelength of the external laser source (often called the "pump") used to introduce energy into the system. 

For instance:
- In optical amplifiers like Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA), a pump laser excites the erbium ions, enabling them to amplify signals at the C-band (~1.55 µm) region.
- In nonlinear processes like four-wave mixing or parametric down-conversion, the pump wavelength is the wavelength at which the external laser source operates to drive these nonlinear processes.

**3. Pump Power**:
The pump power refers to the optical power of the pump laser that's used in nonlinear processes or optical amplification. The magnitude of many nonlinear effects is directly proportional to the intensity (or power) of the light, making pump power a crucial parameter:

- **Higher pump power** can lead to stronger nonlinear interactions. In optical amplifiers, it can result in greater signal amplification, but beyond a certain threshold, it can also introduce distortions or other undesirable effects.
- **Lower pump power** might not be sufficient to observe significant nonlinear effects or achieve the desired level of amplification.

In certain applications, such as supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers, both the pump wavelength and pump power are meticulously chosen to efficiently span a broad spectrum of light.

In summary, ZDW provides a point of reference regarding dispersion properties of an optical fiber. In contrast, pump wavelength and pump power are parameters associated with external sources used in various optical systems to induce nonlinear effects or amplification.

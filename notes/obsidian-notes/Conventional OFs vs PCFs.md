Conventional optical fibers and photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) are both technologies used to guide and transmit light over distances. While they share the core principle of using total internal reflection to guide light, they have several distinguishing features due to their structural differences and working mechanisms.

Here's a comparison between conventional fibers and PCFs:

1. **Structure**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Typically consist of a central core surrounded by cladding. The core has a higher refractive index than the cladding, and this difference in refractive indices enables total internal reflection, which confines light within the core.
   - **PCFs**: Characterized by a microstructured design, usually in the form of a periodic array of air holes running along the entire length of the fiber. The light guidance can be achieved either by modified total internal reflection or photonic bandgap effects, depending on the specific design of the PCF.

2. **Guidance Mechanism**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Solely rely on total internal reflection due to the refractive index difference between the core and cladding.
   - **PCFs**: Can guide light through modified total internal reflection or photonic bandgap guidance, based on the design. The latter allows PCFs to confine light even if the core refractive index is lower than the cladding, a phenomenon impossible in conventional fibers.

3. **Modal Properties**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Generally support multiple modes at longer wavelengths unless designed to be single-mode.
   - **PCFs**: Can be designed as "endlessly single-mode," meaning they support only the fundamental mode across a broad range of wavelengths, regardless of the core size.

4. **Dispersion Control**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Dispersion properties are primarily influenced by the core diameter and the materials used.
   - **PCFs**: Offer enhanced flexibility for tailoring dispersion properties because of the freedom in designing the microstructure.

5. **Nonlinearity**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Nonlinearity is determined by the material composition and core size.
   - **PCFs**: Can be designed to have very high or very low nonlinearities, depending on the application, by tweaking the design parameters like air hole diameter and pitch.

6. **Confinement**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Light is confined in the solid core.
   - **PCFs**: Can have solid or hollow cores. Hollow-core PCFs can achieve light confinement in air or gas, which significantly reduces material nonlinearities and allows for novel applications like gas-based sensing or high-power pulse transmission.

7. **Applications**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Predominantly used for telecommunications, but also find applications in sensors, medical devices, and laser delivery systems.
   - **PCFs**: While they can also be used in telecommunication, their unique properties make them suitable for a broader range of applications, including supercontinuum generation, high-power lasers, sensing (especially with gases), and more.

8. **Fabrication**:
   - **Conventional Fibers**: Relatively mature fabrication processes with a primary focus on material purity and consistency.
   - **PCFs**: Require more intricate fabrication processes to achieve the microstructured design.

In essence, while conventional fibers have been the backbone of optical communication systems for decades, PCFs provide greater flexibility in design and potential for novel applications. However, the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of an application.

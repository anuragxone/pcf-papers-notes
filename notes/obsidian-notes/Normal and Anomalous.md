Normal dispersion and anomalous dispersion refer to the ways in which the phase velocity of light changes as a function of frequency or wavelength in a medium.

**Normal Dispersion**:
1. **Definition**: Normal dispersion occurs when the refractive index (and hence the phase velocity) decreases as the wavelength decreases (or as frequency increases). This is the usual behavior in most transparent materials over a wide range of frequencies.
   
2. **Mathematically**: If \( n(\lambda) \) is the refractive index as a function of wavelength \( \lambda \), then normal dispersion implies:
   \[ \frac{dn}{d\lambda} > 0 \]
   
3. **Physical Basis**: Normal dispersion is primarily a result of the resonant behavior of atoms or molecules in the material. At frequencies well below any resonance, the electrons in the material can easily follow the oscillations of the light wave, leading to normal dispersion.

4. **Example**: The fact that blue light bends more than red light when passing through a prism is due to normal dispersion.

**Anomalous Dispersion**:
1. **Definition**: Anomalous dispersion occurs when the refractive index increases as the wavelength decreases (or as frequency increases). It's the opposite behavior of what is observed in normal dispersion.

2. **Mathematically**: For anomalous dispersion:
   \[ \frac{dn}{d\lambda} < 0 \]
   
3. **Physical Basis**: Anomalous dispersion is observed in regions close to material resonances (e.g., near absorption bands). As the frequency approaches the resonance from below, the refractive index increases, leading to anomalous dispersion. Right at resonance, absorption is significant, and past the resonance frequency, the dispersion becomes normal again.

4. **Importance**: Anomalous dispersion is crucial for certain nonlinear optical phenomena. For instance, the balance between anomalous dispersion and the Kerr nonlinearity in optical fibers can lead to the formation of solitons, which are stable optical pulses that can propagate long distances without broadening.

**Dispersion Curve & Zero Dispersion Wavelength**:
If you plot the refractive index (or the related quantity, the propagation constant) against frequency or wavelength, you'll notice regions of normal and anomalous dispersion. The point where the curve transitions from one to the other is often called the "zero dispersion point" or "zero dispersion wavelength" in the context of optical fibers. This point is significant in fiber-optic communications because the overall chromatic dispersion of the fiber is minimal there.

In summary, normal and anomalous dispersion describe the behavior of light propagation in materials, specifically how the phase velocity of light varies with its frequency. Understanding these concepts is vital for various applications in optics and photonics.

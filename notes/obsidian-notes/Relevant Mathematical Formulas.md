Here are some of the relevant formulas and concepts associated with PCFs:

1. **Effective Refractive Index**: The effective refractive index $(n_{eff})$ of a mode in a PCF is given by the weighted average of the refractive indices of the materials in the mode's field distribution. It's a fundamental parameter when understanding mode propagation.

2. **V-Parameter**: Analogous to standard optical fibers, PCFs have a V-parameter defined as:
\[ $V = \frac{2 \pi a}{\lambda} n_{eff}$ \]
Where:
   - \( a \) is the radius of the core (or some other relevant characteristic size),
   - \( $\lambda$ \) is the operating wavelength.

3. **Confinement Loss**: This represents the loss due to the mode not being completely confined in the core. It can be calculated using various methods including multipole methods, finite element methods, etc. It's especially important for hollow-core PCFs where confinement might not be as strong as solid-core fibers.

4. **Group Velocity Dispersion (GVD)**: Dispersion is crucial for pulse propagation and is given by:
\[ $\beta_2 = \frac{d^2 \beta}{d \omega^2}$ \]
Where:
   - \( $\beta$ \) is the propagation constant,
   - \( $\omega$ \) is the angular frequency.

5. **Effective Mode Area (Aeff)**: It's defined as:
\[ $A_{eff} = \frac{(\int |\psi|^2 dA)^2}{\int |\psi|^4 dA}$ \]
Where:
   - \( $\psi$ \) is the transverse electric field distribution across the mode profile,
   - \( $dA$ \) represents the differential area element in the transverse plane.

The above formulas are just a few in the vast landscape of PCF analysis and design. The design and understanding of PCFs involve solving Maxwell's equations with appropriate boundary conditions, which typically require numerical methods (like Finite Element Method or Finite Difference Time Domain). The choice of method and the specific formulas to employ largely depend on the PCF type and the particular problem one is trying to solve or the property one is trying to investigate.
